# Conditional VAE in JAX

**WIP.**
This repository will (hopefully) contain an implementation of the *conditional variational autoencoder* (CVAE) introduced in [Learning Structured Output Representation using Deep Conditional Generative Models](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2015/hash/8d55a249e6baa5c06772297520da2051-Abstract.html) in JAX.
